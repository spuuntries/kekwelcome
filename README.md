## Dependencies:
As we're running `d.js` v13 for this, it *is* ***required*** for you to install `node.js` v16 to run this module as is.  
However, you *can* remove all v13 changes and change the `package.json` to run this on v12.


## How it works:
This repo contains kek's welcoming module for Art Union, what it does is it:  
1. Gets an introduction message  
2. Grabs a webhook  
3. Sends a welcome ping and asks the ping role to welcome the new person  

Simple enough, lmao.


## Usage:
`mv` or rename `.env copy` to `.env` and change the variables accordingly.
